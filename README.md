**1. Abstraction (Soyutlama)** <br/>
**2. Inheritance (Kalıtım)** <br/>
**3. Encapsulation (Kapsülleme)** <br/>
**4. Polymorphism (Çok Biçimlilik)** <br/>

### 1. ABSTRACTION (Data Hiding)
It is difficult and unnecessary for a programmer to know all the details of a project.
Abstraction means focusing on a project's function rather than its details.
Abstraction is done through the **abstract class** and **interfaces**.

#### Advantages of Abstraction
It reduces the complexity of viewing the things. <br/>
Avoids code duplication and increases reusability. <br/>
Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.<br/>

#### Difference between Abstract Class and Interface? When should we use which and why?
